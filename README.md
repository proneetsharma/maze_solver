# <YOUR_FIRST_NAME><YOUR_LAST_NAME>

# Assignment 3
In this Assignment you will be implementing Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Iterative Deepening Depth First Search.
Please change the <YOUR_FIRST_NAME> and <YOUR_LAST_NAME> tags of this file accordingly and please read the PDF file in this repository to get an idea of the problem statement.

## Coding Guidelines
* Please use .py files provided to code your solutions in **python 3.5 or above**.
* A minimalistic template is provided so that you can organize your ideas and put them into the appropriate functions.
* Please **fill out the docstrings** (function args and return value type and description) after implementation.
* Please **fill out the requirements.txt** if you are using any third party python libraries (Eg: numpy).
* Please add **travis build status label** in markdown format at the top of the README.md. Follow the instructions https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/
* Please add any extra functions if needed in the helper.py.
* Do not clutter your code and try to be more Pythonic in coding.
* Kindly use meaningful identifiers for variable/function/class names. Also add comments to help us easily evaluate your code.

## Deliverables
* Please store the results of the optimal path from the start to each and every goal by backtracking in a <search_algo_name>_<map_number>.txt file (Eg: dfs_map_1.txt). A sample file is available in the results folder showing the backtracked path from one of the goals to the start node.
* The traversal of the search agent through the map must be visible on the console (using appropriate symbols from the pdf).


#### A Failure to adhere to the above instructions Will result in a loss of points.

## Additional Details
**Please add any details which we will need for running and testing your code.**



## Getting started with the assignment
* Clone the repository by first clicking on the green button on the top right to copy the https or ssh link and using the command,
```
git clone <copied link>
```
* Start working on your assignment in your local machine and once you are ready to update your changes on github use the following commands,
```
git add <some-file>
```
```
git commit -m "<give your commit message here within the double quotes>"
```
* It is good practice to often check the status of your staged or committed file using
```
git status
```
* To push your changes to the github repo use,
```
git push origin master
```
